{"name":"Datastax","tagline":"Highly Available Cassandra Infrastructure & Automated Quality Engineering using DevOps methodolgies...","body":"### Welcome to Cassandra\r\n\r\nThere were 3 goals of this project:\r\n\r\nOne was to automate the creation of a small scale highly available, fault-tolerant, big data infrastructure.  \r\nTwo was to leverage puppet to perform an stress test and automate the generation of results.\r\nThree was to leverage yaml to abstract & parametrize the configurations.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nauthor: thomas cappetta\r\nreference authors to be published w/ v1.0\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
